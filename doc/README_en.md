## Contributions

If you are a developer, and you're willing to contribute to this project, please don't hesitate to submit a PR!

This app also uses `intl` to localize. You're welcome to [commit translation](../lib/l10n/intl_en.arb) too.

If you encounter any bugs, please report them after ruling out all network-related causes, as Iwara's servers often experience errors.
